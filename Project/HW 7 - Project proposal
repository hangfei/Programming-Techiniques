HW 7 - Project proposal
=======================
GHC 7.6
##Choose a partner
##Choose a topic
- Perhaps you would like to go deeper into one of the topics that we have covered in this course.
- Perhaps there is an algorithm or library or program that you have studied in a different course and would like to rewrite in Haskell.


- The best projects have some sort of design element to them: whether it is designing a library, or an embedded language, or a new type class, or an application.


- You should do some research on Hackage to see what libraries are already available for you to use.

If there is already code on Hackage to do what you want to do, don't dispair. It is fine to extend, redesign, rethink, or even redo from scratch any of the existing packages. The only caveat is that you acknowledge all outside code that you use (in any form -- as inspiration, as a starting point that you modify and extend, or as a library that you call) and respect their licence agreements.


###Write a 2-3 page document
###Submit a text document
(called Proposal.txt) to the course website. Make sure that you include your name, your pennkey, your partner's name and your partner's pennkey at the top of the file.
